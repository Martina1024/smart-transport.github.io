Leila Hawa graduated from with a civil engineering master's specializing in transportation. Her current research focuses on shared micromobility use in cities. As a result of growing up in New York City and cycling around Montreal since undergrad, Leila loves active transit, especially because of its benefits for improving quality of life and the environment, and is motivated to apply her research to support its growth in cities. Leila also works at SAE as the secretary of the Micromobility Devices and Shared & Digital Mobility committees. After graduation Leila started working at OptiBus as a solution engineer in their office in New York, USA.
