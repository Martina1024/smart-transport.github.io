Wenshuo Wang is currently a Postdoc at Smart City Lab, McGill University. He received his Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2018. Before joint McGill University, he worked as a Postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University (2018-2019) and University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley, 2019-2020). Before 2018, he also worked as a research scholar at UC Berkeley (2015-2017) and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (2017-2018). His research focuses on Bayesian nonparametric learning, reinforcement learning on multi-agent interaction behavior modeling and prediction at human-levels for autonomous vehicles, and intelligent transportation systems in common-but-challenging situations.
